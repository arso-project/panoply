# panoply

*Work in progress*

This likely will be the base for Archipel v2.

Currently:

* A web server with a websocket interface to [hyper-content-db](https://github.com/hyper-content-db) and a HTTP frontend to [hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive)
* A [sonar](https://github.com/Frando/sonar) full-text search view on a hyper-content-db
* A graphical frontend for [hyper-content-db](https://github.com/hyper-content-db), written in React
* Some experimental clients / importers
